# GitHub Project Management Best Practices for TaylorLang

This document outlines the best practices we follow for managing the TaylorLang project using GitHub's native project management tools.

## Overview

GitHub Projects provides integrated project management that stays synchronized with our code repository. We use milestones, issues, labels, and project boards to track progress and coordinate development efforts.

## Milestone Management

### Structure
- **Time-boxed releases**: Create milestones for specific releases (e.g., "v0.1.0 - Core Language")
- **Feature-based milestones**: Group related functionality (e.g., "Type System Implementation")
- **Due dates**: Always set realistic due dates for milestones to track progress

### Naming Conventions
- Release milestones: `v{major}.{minor}.{patch} - {Description}`
- Feature milestones: `{Feature Name} Implementation`
- Sprint milestones: `Sprint {number} - {dates}`

### Best Practices
- Keep 3-5 active milestones maximum
- Review milestone progress weekly
- Close milestones promptly when completed
- Move incomplete issues to next appropriate milestone

## Issue Management

### Issue Types and Labels
- `type: bug` - Something isn't working
- `type: feature` - New feature or enhancement
- `type: documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `type: refactoring` - Code structure improvements
- `type: testing` - Test-related work

### Priority Labels
- `priority: critical` - Blocking other work or breaking existing functionality
- `priority: high` - Important for current milestone
- `priority: medium` - Should be addressed soon
- `priority: low` - Nice to have, not urgent

### Component Labels
- `component: parser` - ANTLR grammar and parsing
- `component: type-system` - Type checking and inference
- `component: codegen` - Bytecode generation
- `component: stdlib` - Standard library
- `component: tooling` - CLI, IDE extensions, build tools

### Issue Structure Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of the issue/feature

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, testable criteria
- [ ] One per line
- [ ] Clear success conditions

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach
- Dependencies on other issues
- Potential risks or blockers

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests needed
- Integration tests needed
- Performance considerations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

### Best Practices
- Break large issues into smaller, manageable tasks (< 1 week of work)
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Assign issues to specific team members
- Link related issues using keywords (closes, fixes, relates to)
- Update issues regularly with progress comments
- Use @mentions for team communication

## Project Board Organization

### Board Views
1. **Kanban Board**: Status-based workflow (Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done)
2. **Roadmap View**: Timeline-based view for milestones and releases
3. **Table View**: Detailed view with all custom fields
4. **Sprint Board**: Current iteration focus

### Custom Fields
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Component**: Parser, Type System, Codegen, Stdlib, Tooling
- **Effort**: 1-3 (story points or time estimation)
- **Assignee**: Team member responsible
- **Sprint**: Current iteration assignment

### Workflow Automation
- Automatically add new issues to "Backlog"
- Move to "In Progress" when PR is opened
- Move to "Review" when PR is ready for review
- Move to "Done" when PR is merged
- Auto-assign milestone based on labels

## Communication Guidelines

### @Mentions Protocol
- `@username` for specific person attention
- `@team/developers` for development team
- Use sparingly to avoid notification fatigue

### Progress Updates
- Weekly milestone progress reviews
- Daily updates on in-progress issues
- Immediate notification for blockers

### Documentation Requirements
- All architectural decisions documented in issues
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for major choices
- Code changes require documentation updates

## Workflow Process

### New Feature Development
1. Create feature issue with full template
2. Add to appropriate milestone
3. Label with type, priority, component
4. Break into smaller implementation tasks if needed
5. Assign to team member
6. Move through board workflow as progress is made

### Bug Triage
1. Immediate labeling with severity
2. Assign to current milestone if critical
3. Reproduce and document steps
4. Assign to component expert
5. Link to any related issues

### Release Process
1. Create release milestone 2-4 weeks in advance
2. Add all planned issues to milestone
3. Weekly milestone review meetings
4. Feature freeze 1 week before due date
5. Final testing and documentation updates
6. Release and close milestone

## Quality Standards

### Definition of Done
Every issue must meet these criteria before closing:
- [ ] Implementation completed per acceptance criteria
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed by team member
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes without migration path

### Code Review Requirements
- All PRs require at least one approval
- PRs should be < 500 lines when possible
- Include tests with implementation
- Update documentation for user-facing changes

## Metrics and Reporting

### Key Metrics to Track
- Milestone completion percentage
- Average issue resolution time
- Bug discovery rate vs. resolution rate
- Team velocity (issues completed per sprint)

### Review Cycles
- Daily: Individual progress updates
- Weekly: Milestone progress review
- Bi-weekly: Retrospective and process improvements
- Monthly: Roadmap and priority adjustments

## Tools Integration

### GitHub Actions
- Automatically run tests on PR creation
- Auto-assign reviewers based on changed files
- Update project board status on PR events
- Generate release notes from closed issues

### IDE Integration
- VS Code extension for creating issues
- GitHub CLI for rapid issue creation
- Project board shortcuts for developers

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating issues too large (>1 week of work)
- Leaving issues unassigned for extended periods
- Not updating issue status regularly
- Missing acceptance criteria or definition of done
- Creating duplicate issues without linking
- Using issues for internal team communication
- Letting milestone due dates slip without adjustment

## Templates

We maintain issue and PR templates in `.github/` directory:
- Bug report template
- Feature request template
- Pull request template
- Release checklist template

Following these practices ensures our project remains organized, transparent, and efficiently managed throughout the development lifecycle.
