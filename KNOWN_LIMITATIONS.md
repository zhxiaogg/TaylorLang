# Known Limitations

This document outlines the current limitations of the TaylorLang compiler implementation as of the latest update.

## Overview

The TaylorLang compiler currently implements a **foundational subset** of the planned language features. The implementation successfully covers:

- ✅ **Complete parsing** of all TaylorLang syntax
- ✅ **Basic type checking** for primitive types and simple expressions
- ⚠️  **Partial type checking** for advanced features (21/38 tests disabled)
- ❌ **No bytecode generation** (stub implementation only)

## Current Capabilities

### ✅ Fully Implemented

1. **Parsing (100% Complete)**
   - Function declarations with type parameters
   - Union type declarations (positioned and named product types)
   - Variable declarations with type inference syntax
   - All expression types (binary ops, unary ops, literals, etc.)
   - Pattern matching syntax
   - Lambda expressions
   - Control flow (if expressions, for loops)
   - Comments and whitespace handling

2. **Basic Type Checking**
   - Primitive type checking (Int, String, Boolean, Float, etc.)
   - Simple binary operations (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
   - Unary operations
   - Variable declarations with type inference
   - Basic function declarations
   - Tuple literal type checking

### ⚠️  Partially Implemented

1. **Advanced Type Checking (55% Complete)**
   - **Missing**: Union type semantics and constructor calls
   - **Missing**: Multi-parameter function type checking
   - **Missing**: Generic function support
   - **Missing**: Nullable types (`String?`)
   - **Missing**: Complex type instantiation (`List<Int>`)
   - **Missing**: Control flow type checking (if expressions, blocks)
   - **Missing**: Property access and index operations
   - **Missing**: Scope management and variable shadowing

### ❌ Not Implemented

1. **Bytecode Generation (0% Complete)**
   - JVM bytecode generation
   - Class file creation
   - Runtime system
   - Standard library integration
   - Program execution

2. **Advanced Language Features**
   - Pattern matching semantics
   - Standard library functions
   - Module system
   - Import/export system

## Impact on Usage

### What Works
```taylorlang
// ✅ These programs parse and type-check successfully
fn add(x: Int, y: Int): Int => x + y
val result = add(1, 2)

type Option<T> = Some(T) | None
type Person = Student(name: String) | Teacher(subject: String)

// ✅ Basic expressions work
val x = 42
val y = "hello"
val z = true
val tuple = (1, "test")
```

### What Doesn't Work
```taylorlang
// ❌ These fail type checking (tests disabled)
fn multi(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int): Int => a + b + c  // Multi-param functions
val nullable: String? = null                        // Nullable types
val generic: List<Int> = List.of(1, 2, 3)         // Generic instantiation

// ❌ Control flow type checking fails
val conditional = if (x > 0) "positive" else "negative"
val block = { val temp = 10; temp * 2 }

// ❌ No bytecode generation - programs cannot run
// Compilation succeeds but produces no executable output
```

## GitHub Issues Created

The following GitHub issues track the missing implementations:

## Test Status

### Test Suite Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 77
- **Passing**: 56 (72.7%)
- **Disabled**: 21 (27.3%)
- **Failed**: 0

### Test Categories
- **ParserTest**: 39/39 tests passing (100%)
- **TypeCheckerTest**: 17/38 tests passing (45%)

All disabled tests have corresponding GitHub issues for tracking implementation.

## Performance and Quality

### Strengths
- **Robust parsing**: Handles all planned syntax correctly
- **Functional design**: Uses immutable data structures and Arrow for error handling
- **Type safety**: Extensive use of sealed classes and null safety
- **Modern Kotlin**: Leverages latest Kotlin idioms and best practices
- **Comprehensive testing**: Good test coverage with clear test descriptions

### Areas for Improvement
- **Type checker completeness**: Many advanced features not implemented
- **Error messages**: Could be more user-friendly
- **Performance**: No optimization work done yet
- **Documentation**: API documentation could be improved

## Roadmap Priority

Based on the PR feedback and current state:

1. **High Priority**: 
   - Fix union type handling in TypeChecker
   - Multi-parameter function support
   - Basic bytecode generation

2. **Medium Priority**: 
   - Advanced type features (generics, nullables)
   - Control flow type checking
   - Standard library support

3. **Low Priority**: 
   - Performance optimization
   - Advanced tooling
   - Language server protocol

## Developer Notes

### For Contributors
- All parsing works correctly - focus on TypeChecker implementations
- Tests are well-structured and provide clear implementation guidance
- Follow the functional programming patterns already established
- Use Arrow's Either type for error handling

### For Users
- The compiler can validate TaylorLang syntax and basic semantics
- Use it for syntax validation and basic type checking
- Programs cannot be executed yet due to missing bytecode generation
- Check GitHub issues for implementation timeline

## Conclusion

TaylorLang has a **solid foundation** with complete parsing and basic type checking. The architecture is sound and follows modern functional programming principles. The main limitation is the incomplete TypeChecker implementation and missing bytecode generation.

The codebase is well-positioned for rapid development of the missing features, with clear test cases and GitHub issues guiding the implementation work.
