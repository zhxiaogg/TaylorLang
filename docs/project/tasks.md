**Implementation**:
```kotlin
// Change from:
fun isNumeric(type: Type): Boolean {
    return numericTypes.contains(type)  // BAD: uses object identity
}

// To:
fun isNumeric(type: Type): Boolean {
    return numericTypes.any { it.structurallyEquals(type) }  // GOOD: structural equality
}
```

**Status**: Planned  
**Component**: Error Handling  
**Effort**: Small (2 days)  
**Dependencies**: TypeChecker error extraction

**WHY**: Error handling is scattered across components with inconsistent reporting and no central error collection.

**WHAT**: Create ErrorCollector service for aggregating and reporting errors consistently.

**HOW**:
- Research error handling patterns in compilers
- Study error recovery strategies
- Look into error aggregation patterns
- Examine user-friendly error reporting (Rust, Elm)

**SCOPE**:
- Day 1: Design and implement ErrorCollector
- Day 2: Integrate with existing components

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- Single ErrorCollector manages all compilation errors
- Consistent error format across all components
- Support for error recovery (continue after error)
- Rich error messages with suggestions
- Source location tracking for all errors
- Easy to add new error types

**RESOURCES**:
- Rust compiler's error handling
- Elm's friendly error messages
- Compiler Construction books (error recovery)
- Google's error handling guidelines

### Priority 4: Future-Proofing

#### Task: Design AST Transformer Framework
**Status**: Planned  
**Component**: AST  
**Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)  
**Dependencies**: Visitor Pattern Infrastructure

**WHY**: Future optimization passes will need to transform AST; having framework ready will accelerate development.

**WHAT**: Create framework for AST transformation passes (optimization, desugaring, etc.).

**HOW**:
- Research AST transformation in modern compilers
- Study immutable tree transformation patterns
- Look into lens/optics for functional updates
- Examine LLVM's pass infrastructure

**SCOPE**:
- Day 1: Design transformer interface and base implementation
- Day 2: Implement example transformer (e.g., constant folding)
- Day 3: Create transformation pipeline infrastructure

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ASTTransformer interface defined
- At least one example transformer implemented
- Transformation pipeline can chain multiple passes
- Immutability preserved throughout transformations
- Easy to add new transformation passes
- Performance acceptable for large ASTs

**RESOURCES**:
- LLVM Pass infrastructure documentation
- Functional programming tree transformations
- Kotlin Arrow library (optics)
- Compiler optimization books

### Medium Priority

#### Task: Standard Library Collections

**Description**: Implement immutable collection types (List, Map, Set).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Immutable List implementation
- Immutable Map implementation  
- Immutable Set implementation
- Basic functional operations (map, filter, fold)
- Java interoperability

## Task Management Guidelines

### Task States
- **Planned**: Not yet started, in backlog
- **In Progress**: Actively being worked on
- **Blocked**: Waiting on dependencies or decisions
- **Review**: Implementation complete, under review
- **Completed**: Fully done and tested

### Creating New Tasks
1. Add to appropriate priority section
2. Include all required fields
3. Link dependencies explicitly
4. Estimate effort realistically
5. Define clear acceptance criteria

### Task Updates
- Update status daily
- Add progress notes for long-running tasks
- Document blockers immediately
- Link related commits and PRs
