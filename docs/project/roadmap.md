## Technical Decisions

### Confirmed Architecture

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Implementation | Kotlin | Modern, functional, JVM native |
| Parser | ANTLR 4 | Industry standard, good tooling |
| Type System | Hindley-Milner | Proven, powerful inference |
| Code Gen | ASM | Direct bytecode control |
| Collections | Arrow/PCollections | Efficient persistent structures |
| Testing | Kotest | BDD-style, property testing |

### Open Questions

1. **Module System**: Package-based vs explicit modules?
2. **Macro System**: Compile-time metaprogramming support?
3. **Effect System**: Tracked effects vs monadic IO?
4. **Async Model**: Coroutines vs futures vs actors?

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Compilation speed: < 1000 LOC/second
- Runtime performance: Within 2x of Java
- Memory overhead: < 20% vs Java
- Type inference: > 95% of types inferred

### Adoption Metrics
- GitHub stars: 1000+ by end of 2025
- Active contributors: 10+
- Production deployments: 5+
- VS Code extension installs: 500+

## Risk Analysis

### High Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Type inference complexity | High | Incremental implementation, extensive testing |
| JVM integration issues | High | Early prototyping, Java expert consultation |
| Performance problems | Medium | Continuous benchmarking, optimization sprints |
| Limited adoption | Medium | Focus on developer experience, clear value prop |
