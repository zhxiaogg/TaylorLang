## Current Status

### Active Development - Phase 3: JVM Bytecode Generation
1. **JVM Bytecode Generation Foundation** - Setting up ASM framework and basic bytecode generation
   - ðŸš€ ASM library integration (NEXT TASK)
   - Basic class file generation
   - Simple expression compilation
   - Generated class loading in JVM

### Recently Completed (Sprint 3 - TypeChecker Stabilization)
