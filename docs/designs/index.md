# Technical Design Documents

This directory contains technical design documents for TaylorLang components.

## Design Documents

- [Constructor Deconstruction Patterns](./constructor-deconstruction-patterns.md) - **ACTIVE** - Technical design for fixing list pattern failures and implementing constructor deconstruction pattern matching
- [Comprehensive Pattern Matching Design](./comprehensive-pattern-matching.md) - Complete analysis and implementation plan for pattern matching specification support
- [Try Syntax Implementation](./try-syntax-implementation.md) - Technical design for functional error handling with try expressions and Result types
- [Unification Algorithm](./unification-algorithm.md) - Type constraint solving and substitution generation for type inference
- [Type Inference Integration](./type-inference-integration.md) - Integration of constraint-based inference with TypeChecker
- [Centralized Type Operations](./centralized-type-operations.md) - Centralized type operations and utilities

## Guidelines

Design documents should be:
- **Concise**: Focus on key decisions and architecture
- **Precise**: Clear specifications without ambiguity  
- **Complete**: Include problem, requirements, solution, implementation notes
- **Traceable**: Reference research and architectural decisions

Each document should clearly specify:
- **Problem**: What needs to be solved
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Solution**: Architectural approach and key design decisions
- **Implementation Notes**: Important details for implementation
- **Dependencies**: What this depends on and what depends on it
