# Technical Design Documents

This directory contains technical design documents for TaylorLang components.

## Design Documents

- [Unification Algorithm](./unification-algorithm.md) - Type constraint solving and substitution generation for type inference

## Guidelines

Design documents should be:
- **Concise**: Focus on key decisions and architecture
- **Precise**: Clear specifications without ambiguity  
- **Complete**: Include problem, requirements, solution, implementation notes
- **Traceable**: Reference research and architectural decisions

Each document should clearly specify:
- **Problem**: What needs to be solved
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Solution**: Architectural approach and key design decisions
- **Implementation Notes**: Important details for implementation
- **Dependencies**: What this depends on and what depends on it
