# Language Overview

## Language Philosophy

A minimal, pure functional, and practical language for the JVM that emphasizes:
- **Developer-friendly syntax** borrowing from modern languages
- **Functional programming** with immutability by default
- **Type safety** with Hindley-Milner type inference
- **Seamless Java interoperability**
- **Practical effects system** for real-world applications

## Core Principles

### Immutability by Default
Variables are immutable unless explicitly declared as mutable, encouraging safer and more predictable code.

### Type Safety with Inference
The language uses Hindley-Milner type inference, providing strong type safety without requiring verbose type annotations in most cases.

### Functional Programming
Built around functional programming concepts with support for higher-order functions, algebraic data types, and pattern matching.

### Java Ecosystem Integration
Seamlessly integrates with existing Java libraries and frameworks while providing a more expressive and safe programming model.

### Practical Effects System
Manages side effects explicitly through the type system while remaining practical for real-world applications.
