# TaylorLang Tech Lead Knowledge Base

## Project Analysis Log

### 2025-08-10 Initial Assessment

#### Current State Analysis
- **Project Type**: Functional programming language for JVM
- **Technology Stack**: Kotlin, ANTLR 4, Gradle
- **Architecture**: Parser -> AST -> Type Checker -> (Future: Bytecode Gen)

#### Completed Features
1. **Parser & AST**: ANTLR grammar complete, AST nodes defined
2. **Union Types**: Fully implemented with pattern matching (94% test pass rate)
3. **Type Checker**: Basic implementation with union type support
4. **Pattern Matching**: Exhaustiveness checking implemented

#### Test Results Analysis (91 tests, 3 failures, 11 skipped)
- **Passing**: 88 tests (96.7% of non-skipped)
- **Failures**: 
  - Non-exhaustive match detection working correctly (expected failure)
  - Constructor pattern arity validation issue
  - Complex function expressions in match not supported
- **Skipped**: Advanced features not yet implemented (nullable, tuples, collections)

#### Current Sprint Status
- **Union Type Implementation**: COMPLETED (2025-08-10)
- **Constraint Data Model**: ASSIGNED to kotlin-java-engineer
- **Next Priority**: Complete Type Inference Engine foundation

#### Architecture Decisions

##### Type Inference Strategy
Based on research of modern functional languages (Haskell, OCaml, F#):
1. **Algorithm Choice**: Hindley-Milner with constraint-based approach
2. **Implementation Path**: 
   - Build constraint infrastructure first (current task)
   - Implement constraint collection from AST
   - Implement unification algorithm
   - Integrate with existing TypeChecker
3. **Key Design Principles**:
   - Immutable data structures for constraints
   - Source location tracking for better error messages
   - Bidirectional type checking for performance
   - Let-polymorphism for local type inference

##### Task Decomposition Strategy
- Small tasks (1-2 days): Infrastructure, data models, utilities
- Medium tasks (2-3 days): Algorithm implementations, integrations
- Large tasks avoided: Break down into multiple smaller tasks
- Each task must be independently testable

#### Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Type inference complexity may require algorithm refinements
   - JVM bytecode generation will be challenging (ASM framework)
   - Java interop needs careful type mapping

2. **Project Risks**:
   - 11 skipped tests indicate significant feature gaps
   - No bytecode generation yet limits practical use
   - No standard library implementation

#### Next Priority Analysis

Based on the current state and roadmap, the logical progression is:

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete Type Inference foundation (in progress)
   - Constraint Data Model (ASSIGNED)
   - Constraint Collection (next)
   - Unification Algorithm
   - Integration

2. **NEXT SPRINT**: JVM Bytecode Generation
   - Critical for making language usable
   - Enables testing with real JVM execution
   - Required before standard library

3. **FOLLOWING**: Standard Library
   - Collections first (List, Map, Set)
   - IO operations
   - Java interop helpers

## Technical Research Notes

### Type Inference Implementation References
- **Hindley-Milner**: Classic algorithm, proven correctness
- **Algorithm W**: Standard implementation approach
- **Constraint-based**: Modern approach, better error messages
- **References**:
  - "Types and Programming Languages" (Pierce)
  - OCaml's type inference implementation
  - Kotlin's local type inference

### JVM Bytecode Generation
- **ASM Framework**: De facto standard for bytecode manipulation
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Functional constructs to imperative bytecode
  - Closure implementation
  - Tail call optimization
- **References**:
  - Clojure's compiler implementation
  - Scala's bytecode generation

### Pattern Matching Implementation
- **Current Status**: Basic exhaustiveness checking
- **Needed Improvements**:
  - Guard conditions
  - Nested patterns
  - View patterns
- **References**:
  - Haskell's pattern matching
  - Rust's match expressions

## Decision Log

### 2025-08-10 Decisions
1. **Proceed with Constraint Collection task**: The constraint data model is assigned, next logical step is collection
2. **Focus on correctness over optimization**: Get inference working first, optimize later
3. **Maintain high test coverage**: Every new feature needs comprehensive tests
4. **Document as we go**: Update language docs with each feature addition

## Task Creation Guidelines

### Effective Task Structure
1. **WHY**: Business/technical value clearly stated
2. **WHAT**: Specific, measurable outcome
3. **HOW**: Research topics, patterns, not prescriptive code
4. **SCOPE**: 1-3 days maximum, single component
5. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Testable, specific requirements
6. **RESOURCES**: Documentation, examples, papers to reference

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Tasks over 3 days (break them down)
- Prescriptive implementation details
- Missing acceptance criteria
- No test requirements
- Unclear dependencies
