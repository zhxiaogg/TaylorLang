# TaylorLang Tech Lead Analysis & Decision Log

## Project Overview
TaylorLang is a modern programming language targeting the JVM with advanced type system features including union types, pattern matching, and constraint-based type inference.

## Current Phase: JVM Bytecode Generation (Phase 3)

### Recent Milestone Achievement - TypeChecker Stabilization Complete (2025-08-10)

#### Summary
- Successfully resolved ALL critical blocking issues in TypeChecker
- Refactored ExpressionTypeChecker from 881 lines to 4 compliant components
- Fixed numeric type comparison bugs using structural equality
- Standardized error aggregation across all visitors
- All core tests now passing - project builds successfully

#### Key Decisions Made
1. **Approved TypeChecker refactoring** - Clean separation of concerns achieved
2. **Deferred minor issues** - 6 constraint-based tests and 2 pattern matching tests marked as medium priority
3. **Prioritized Phase 3** - JVM bytecode generation is the next critical milestone

### Next Immediate Task - JVM Bytecode Generation Foundation

#### Task Assignment for kotlin-java-engineer
**Component**: Code Generation  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Phase 3 kickoff  
**Timeline**: 3-4 days  

#### Task Definition
**WHY**: We need to generate executable JVM bytecode to make TaylorLang programs runnable, validating our type system and enabling real-world usage.

**WHAT**: Set up ASM framework and implement basic bytecode generation infrastructure that can compile simple TaylorLang programs to JVM class files.

**HOW**: 
- Research ASM library best practices and JVM bytecode structure
- Study how Kotlin/Scala generate JVM bytecode
- Implement visitor pattern for AST to bytecode transformation
- Start with simple expressions and gradually add complexity

**SCOPE**:
- Day 1: ASM library integration and project setup
- Day 2: Basic class file generation with main method
- Day 3: Simple expression compilation (literals, arithmetic)
- Day 4: Testing and validation of generated bytecode

**SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
- ASM library properly integrated into build.gradle
- Can generate valid .class files that load in JVM
- Simple arithmetic expressions compile and execute correctly
- Generated bytecode passes Java bytecode verifier
- At least 10 tests validating bytecode generation
- Can run compiled TaylorLang program with `java ClassName`

**RESOURCES**:
- ASM User Guide: https://asm.ow2.io/asm4-guide.pdf
- JVM Specification: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se17/html/
- Kotlin Compiler Source: https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/compiler/backend/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/codegen
- Writing Compilers with ASM: https://www.baeldung.com/asm

### Implementation Approach
1. Create new package: `org.taylorlang.codegen`
2. Implement `BytecodeGenerator` using visitor pattern
3. Start with minimal viable compiler:
   - Generate class with main method
   - Compile integer literals
   - Add arithmetic operations
4. Gradually expand to cover more language features
5. Ensure each feature has comprehensive tests

## Architecture Analysis & Technical Debt

### Recent TypeChecker Refactoring (2025-08-10)

#### ExpressionTypeChecker Split
Successfully refactored the 881-line ExpressionTypeChecker into 4 focused components:

1. **LiteralTypeChecker.kt** (136 lines)
   - Handles all literal type checking
   - Clean, focused responsibility

2. **OperatorTypeChecker.kt** (260 lines)
   - Binary and unary operators
   - Type promotion logic
   - Well-organized and testable

3. **ControlFlowTypeChecker.kt** (268 lines)
   - If expressions, match expressions, blocks
   - Pattern matching support
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **CallAndAccessTypeChecker.kt** (239 lines)
   - Function calls, constructor calls
   - Property access, array operations
   - Method calls and lambda expressions

5. **ExpressionTypeChecker.kt** (152 lines)
   - Coordinator/facade pattern
   - Clean delegation to specialized checkers

#### Error Aggregation Standardization
- Implemented consistent MultipleErrors usage across all visitors
- Fixed error collection in pattern matching
- Standardized error reporting patterns

#### Numeric Type Fix
- Resolved critical bug where types with different source locations were incorrectly considered different
- Implemented structural equality checking in BuiltinTypes
- Fixed isNumeric(), getWiderNumericType(), and related methods

### Outstanding Technical Debt

#### File Size Analysis
**Critical Issues (Files >500 lines):**
1. **TypeChecker.kt**: 1773 lines - CRITICAL (3x recommended size)
2. **ConstraintCollector.kt**: 1298 lines - CRITICAL (2.5x recommended size)
3. **Unifier.kt**: 569 lines - MODERATE (slightly over threshold)
4. **ASTBuilder.kt**: 548 lines - MODERATE (slightly over threshold)

**Test Files (also need attention):**
1. **TypeCheckerTest.kt**: 972 lines - needs splitting by concern
2. **ParserTest.kt**: 651 lines - moderate issue
3. **ConstraintCollectorTest.kt**: 600 lines - moderate issue

#### Architectural Issues Identified

##### 1. TypeChecker.kt - Multiple Responsibilities Violation
**Current Responsibilities:**
- Error type definitions (6 error classes)
- Context management (TypeContext, FunctionSignature, TypeDefinition)
- Builtin type definitions
- Type checking logic (39 methods)
- Type inference integration
- Type compatibility checking
- Type unification logic
- Typed AST node definitions

**Single Responsibility Violations:**
- Mixing data models with business logic
- Combining error definitions with checking logic
- Merging context management with type checking
- Including both algorithmic and constraint-based approaches

##### 2. ConstraintCollector.kt - Monolithic Handler Pattern
**Current Structure:**
- Single class with 50+ methods
- Each expression type has its own handler method
- No use of Visitor pattern despite traversing AST
- Repetitive constraint generation logic
- Mixed concerns of traversal and constraint creation

##### 3. AST Package - Missing Visitor Infrastructure
**Current Issues:**
- No visitor pattern support for AST traversal
- Each component reimplements traversal logic
- No separation between mutable/immutable AST
- Missing builder pattern for complex AST construction

##### 4. Type System - Scattered Type Operations
**Current Issues:**
- Type operations spread across multiple files
- No centralized type factory or builder
- Type substitution logic duplicated in multiple places
- Missing type visitor for recursive operations

### Design Pattern Opportunities

#### 1. Visitor Pattern for AST Traversal
**Rationale:** Multiple components traverse AST (Parser, TypeChecker, ConstraintCollector, future BytecodeGenerator)
**Benefits:**
- Eliminate duplicate traversal code
- Separate traversal from operations
- Enable double dispatch for type safety
- Support multiple traversal strategies

#### 2. Strategy Pattern for Type Checking Modes
**Current:** Enum with if/else branching
**Proposed:** Strategy pattern with TypeCheckingStrategy interface
**Benefits:**
- Open/closed principle compliance
- Easier testing of each strategy
- Clear separation of algorithmic vs constraint-based

#### 3. Factory Pattern for Type Construction
**Current:** Direct instantiation scattered throughout
**Proposed:** TypeFactory with builder methods
**Benefits:**
- Centralized type creation
- Validation at creation time
- Caching for common types
- Easier refactoring

#### 4. Command Pattern for Constraints
**Current:** Data classes with external processing
**Proposed:** Constraints as commands with execute methods
**Benefits:**
- Encapsulate constraint solving logic
- Support undo/redo for backtracking
- Queue constraints for batch processing

#### 5. Builder Pattern for Complex AST Nodes
**Current:** Long constructor parameter lists
**Proposed:** Fluent builders for complex nodes
**Benefits:**
- Readable construction code
- Optional parameters handling
- Validation during construction

   - Create visitor interfaces
   - Implement base visitor
   - Migrate one component as proof
2. **Split TypeChecker.kt** (2 days)
   - Extract error types
   - Extract context management
   - Extract type definitions
3. **Implement Type Checking Strategies** (2 days)
   - Create strategy interface
   - Refactor mode switching

#### Phase 2: Pattern Applications (1 week)

### Performance Considerations

#### Current Bottlenecks
1. **Type Creation Overhead**: No caching of common types
2. **Repeated AST Traversals**: Each phase re-traverses entire AST
3. **String Concatenation**: Extensive use in error messages
4. **List Operations**: Many temporary list creations

#### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Type Interning**: Cache commonly used types
2. **Single-Pass Compilation**: Combine phases where possible
3. **StringBuilder Usage**: For error message construction
4. **Immutable Collections**: Use persistent data structures

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Current State
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Several methods >10 (needs reduction)
- **Code Duplication**: ~15% (target: <5%)
- **Test Coverage**: ~85% (target: >90%)
- **Documentation Coverage**: ~60% (needs improvement)

#### Quality Goals
1. No method longer than 30 lines
2. No class longer than 500 lines
3. Test coverage >90%
4. All public APIs documented
5. Cyclomatic complexity <10 per method

### Future Architecture Considerations

#### Compiler Pipeline Design
```
Source Code → Lexer → Parser → AST Builder → 
Type Checker → Optimizer → Code Generator → Bytecode
```

**Current Gaps:**
- No optimization phase
- No intermediate representation (IR)
- No separate semantic analysis phase

#### Proposed Intermediate Representation
- Simplify code generation
- Enable optimizations
- Support multiple backends (JVM, LLVM, etc.)

#### Module System Design
- Package-level visibility
- Module boundaries
- Export/import declarations
- Version management

### Risk Assessment

#### Technical Risks
1. **High Priority**: Large file sizes impeding development
2. **Medium Priority**: Lack of visitor pattern causing duplication
3. **Low Priority**: Missing optimization phase

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Immediate**: Refactor files >500 lines
2. **Short-term**: Implement visitor pattern
3. **Long-term**: Design IR and optimization framework
