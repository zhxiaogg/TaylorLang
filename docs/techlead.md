- **Constraint Data Model**: COMPLETED and REVIEWED (2025-08-10)
- **Next Priority**: Constraint Collection from AST

#### Architecture Decisions

##### Type Inference Strategy
Based on research of modern functional languages (Haskell, OCaml, F#):
1. **Algorithm Choice**: Hindley-Milner with constraint-based approach
2. **Implementation Path**: 
   - Build constraint infrastructure first (current task)
   - Implement constraint collection from AST
   - Implement unification algorithm
   - Integrate with existing TypeChecker
3. **Key Design Principles**:
   - Immutable data structures for constraints
   - Source location tracking for better error messages

   - Let-polymorphism for local type inference

##### Task Decomposition Strategy
- Small tasks (1-2 days): Infrastructure, data models, utilities
- Medium tasks (2-3 days): Algorithm implementations, integrations
- Large tasks avoided: Break down into multiple smaller tasks
- Each task must be independently testable

#### Risk Assessment
1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Type inference complexity may require algorithm refinements
   - JVM bytecode generation will be challenging (ASM framework)
   - Java interop needs careful type mapping

2. **Project Risks**:
   - 11 skipped tests indicate significant feature gaps
   - No bytecode generation yet limits practical use
   - No standard library implementation

#### Next Priority Analysis

Based on the current state and roadmap, the logical progression is:

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Complete Type Inference foundation (in progress)
   - Constraint Data Model (ASSIGNED)
   - Constraint Collection (next)
   - Unification Algorithm
   - Integration

2. **NEXT SPRINT**: JVM Bytecode Generation
   - Critical for making language usable

   - `Constraint.getTypeVarsFromType()` returns empty set (placeholder)
   - These are acknowledged with TODO comments and are acceptable as they require Type hierarchy integration

2. **Design Considerations**:
   - ConstraintSet doesn't deduplicate constraints (by design, but worth noting)
   - No validation of constraint consistency at creation time (appropriate for this phase)

#### Integration Notes
- Clean separation from existing Type hierarchy
- Will need integration points when TypeVar becomes part of Type hierarchy
- SourceLocation properly imported from existing AST module

**Decision**: **APPROVED** âœ…

The implementation is of exceptional quality with thoughtful design, comprehensive testing, and excellent documentation. The placeholder methods are acceptable as they require future integration with the Type hierarchy. The code is production-ready for this phase of the project.

**Review Findings**:

#### Strengths

1. **Excellent Architecture & Design**:
   - Clean separation between Substitution and Unifier classes
   - Immutable data structures using kotlinx.collections.immutable throughout
   - Functional programming approach with immutable substitutions
   - Proper composition and mathematical operations on substitutions
   - Type.TypeVar properly integrated into the AST hierarchy

   - Works well for current use cases but could be more robust
   - Consider adding explicit TypeVar marker in future

#### Integration Quality

- Seamless integration with existing Type hierarchy
- Clean API with static factory methods
- Result type properly used for error handling
- Works well with constraint collection system
- Ready for integration into TypeChecker

**Decision**: **APPROVED** âœ…

The unification algorithm implementation is of exceptional quality, demonstrating deep understanding of type inference theory and excellent software engineering practices. Robinson's algorithm is correctly implemented with proper occurs checking and comprehensive handling of all type constructors. The 94% test pass rate with 101 tests shows robust implementation. The failing integration tests are due to constraint collection issues (numeric type promotion), not unification problems. The code is production-ready for this phase of the project.

**Recommendations for Next Steps**:
1. Address numeric type promotion in constraint collector for arithmetic operations
2. Integrate unification into TypeChecker for end-to-end type inference
3. Enhance subtype constraint handling when subtyping rules are defined
4. Consider adding type variable bounds for constrained type parameters

## Sprint 2 Completion Analysis (2025-08-10)

5. **SUCCESS CRITERIA**: Testable, specific requirements
6. **RESOURCES**: Documentation, examples, papers to reference

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
- Tasks over 3 days (break them down)
- Prescriptive implementation details
- Missing acceptance criteria
- No test requirements
- Unclear dependencies

## 2025-08-10 Codebase Refactoring Analysis

2. **ConstraintCollector.kt**: 1298 lines - CRITICAL (2.5x recommended size)
3. **Unifier.kt**: 569 lines - MODERATE (slightly over threshold)
4. **ASTBuilder.kt**: 548 lines - MODERATE (slightly over threshold)

**Test Files (also need attention):**
1. **TypeCheckerTest.kt**: 972 lines - needs splitting by concern
2. **ParserTest.kt**: 651 lines - moderate issue
3. **ConstraintCollectorTest.kt**: 600 lines - moderate issue

#### 3. Factory Pattern for Type Construction
**Current:** Direct instantiation scattered throughout
**Proposed:** TypeFactory with builder methods
**Benefits:**
- Centralized type creation
- Validation at creation time
- Caching for common types
- Easier refactoring

#### 4. Command Pattern for Constraints
**Current:** Data classes with external processing
**Proposed:** Constraints as commands with execute methods
**Benefits:**
- Encapsulate constraint solving logic
- Support undo/redo for backtracking
- Queue constraints for batch processing

#### 5. Builder Pattern for Complex AST Nodes
**Current:** Long constructor parameter lists
**Proposed:** Fluent builders for complex nodes
